      <h2>Technical Description</h2>
      <p>
        The
        <a
          href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32015L2366&from=EN"
          >Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2)</a
        >
        instructs banks to provide a fully productive Access-to-Account (XS2A)
        interface to Third Party Providers (TPPs) until September 2019. XS2A
        itself consists of banking services to initiate payments (PIS), request
        account data (AIS) and get the confirmation of the availability of funds
        (PIIS). In order to guarantee the compliance of this deadline due to
        adaptions and bugs, PSD2 claims the banks to provide a functional
        sandbox offering the XS2A services in a non-productive environment until
        March 2019.
      </p>
      <p>
        Central component of the sandbox is the XS2A interface which meets the
        requirements of the
        <a href="https://www.berlin-group.org/">Berlin Group</a> (Version 1.2)
        and is based on test data. Besides the actual interface, PSD2 instructs
        banks to offer a technical documentation free of charge containing
        amongst others, information about supported payment products and payment
        services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, before accessing the XS2A services a TPP would need to register
        at its National Competent Authority (NCA) and request an
        <a
          href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014R0910&from=EN"
          >eIDAS</a
        >
        certificate at an appropriate Trust Service Provider (TSP). Issuing a
        real certificate just for testing purposes would be a bit too much
        effort, which is why this sandbox is additionally simulating a fictional
        TSP issuing Qualified Website Authentication Certificates (QWAC). A QWAC
        is part of eIDAS and might be better known as
        <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3739.txt">X.509</a> certificate.
        For PSD2-purposes the certificate gets extended by the QcStatement
        containing appropriate values such as the role(s) of the PSP (see
        <a
          href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119400_119499/119495/01.01.02_60/ts_119495v010102p.pdf"
          >ETSI</a
        >).
      </p>
      <p>
        After embedding the QWAC in the actual XS2A request, the role and the
        signature get validated at a central reverse proxy before it gets
        finally passed to the interface where the banking logic happens. You can

      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <p>
        In order to test the services of XS2A you need to execute the following
        steps:
      </p>
      <p class="description description__intro">Register/Login</p>
      <p>User registration/Login is coming soon.</p>
      <p class="description description__intro">Generate Certificate</p>
      <p>
        To generate a QWAC Certificate follow this link
        <a routerLink="/certificate-service">Certificate Service UI</a> and
        embed the .pem file in the response header "tpp-qwac-certficate" (see
        example cURL below).
      </p>
      <p class="description description__intro">Fictional PSU Data</p>
      <p>
        To execute services of XS2A, you have to use the following PSU
        credentials
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>PSU-ID: PSU-1</li>
        <li>Password: 12345</li>
        <li>Account:</li>
