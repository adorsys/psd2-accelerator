# Certificate Service

---

We issue Qualified Website Authentication Certificates (QWAC) to
Payment Service Providers (PSP) in order to use services offered at
the Access-to-Account (XS2A) interface of the adorsys PSD2
Accelerator.

Usually each PSP has to be registered at the National Competent
Authority (NCA) to receive an Authorisation Number. We allow you to
skip this step and define a fake Authorisation Number yourself.

Performing the Certificate Service will generate a shared
cryptographic key pair signed by the adorsys Sample Trust Service
Provider. The Public Key which is also referred to a QWAC must be used
for authentication purposes at XS2A.
